I am a teaching assistant (Maître de Conférences) in Lens, in northern France.
Half of my time is spent teaching young programmers at the [IUT](https://www.iut-lens.univ-artois.fr/) in the Computer Science department.
The other half is spent doing research in the [Laboratoire de Mathématiques de Lens](http://lml.univ-artois.fr/public/index-en.html).

Before joining Lens, I was a post-doc in the Inria team Macaron (previously [TONUS](https://team.inria.fr/tonus/)) and [IRMA](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/) in Strasbourg, working with C. Courtès, E. Franck, M. Kraus and L. Navoret. 
Before that, I was a graduate assistant at [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) as a member of the [Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/) in Grenoble. 
I completed my PhD in December 2021 in Rennes under the supervision of P. Chartier and M. Lemou.

My research focuses on multi-scale and geometric methods in a numerical context. 
More specifically, I study the properties of asymptotic expansions and use them to obtain better numerical convergence in stiff problems. 
During my PhD, I worked on relaxation problems such as the linear Boltzmann equation, and more recently I worked on the Bloch equation. 
For my post-doc, I study the properties of geometric machine learning when reconstructing vector fields based on trajectories.
