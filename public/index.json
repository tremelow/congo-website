Before that, I was a graduate assistant at Ensimag as a member of the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann in Grenoble. I completed my PhD in December 2021 in Rennes under the supervision of P. Chartier and M. Lemou.\nMy research focuses on multi-scale and geometric methods in a numerical context. More specifically, I study the properties of asymptotic expansions and use them to obtain better numerical convergence in stiff problems. During my PhD, I worked on relaxation problems such as the linear Boltzmann equation, and more recently I worked on the Bloch equation. For my post-doc, I study the properties of geometric machine learning when reconstructing vector fields based on trajectories.\ntremant-research \u0026lt;at\u0026gt; pm.me\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Website of Léopold Trémant","summary":"2023\u0026ndash;now postdoc in the Inria team Macaron (previously TONUS)","title":"Website of Léopold Trémant"}]
